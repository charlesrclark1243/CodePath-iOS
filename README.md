## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

The biggest challenge when I was creating this app was getting used to the macOS system. I've been using Windows computers for my entire life, so using a macOS system was definitely difficult to do. I only purchased my MacBook yesterday, before I applied for the CodePath iOS course, so I hadn't had much of a chance to get used to it either. What I've done in this program does not seem like much, however given these aforementioned circumstances, I'm extremely proud of what I was able to accomplish today.s
